# Financial-Services-Equity
An in-depth view of the US Consumer Finance Market &amp; Equity in Credit Lending.

## Project Inspiration
As a strategy analyst and advisor to the CEO for a Consumer Finance corporation in the UAE, I gained valuable insights into the credit lending operations and the various considerations for a creditor at every stage of the consumer credit cycle. This also helped me understand why and how certain biases and inequities get propagated into the banking system, which in turn cause disparities in access to credit and cause an amplification of income or wealth inequality in society.

<br>
The innumerous stories of federal government employees living paycheck to paycheck and who are now forced to take drastic measures during the ongoing government shutdown inspired me to review why and how the banking and financial services system has failed the middle-class in the largest economy in the world.

## Project Description
Leveraging the data collected and published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), I would like to examine the level of inequity in the US consumer finance market, year-on-year trends in the same, and try to identify key factors behind it. This, hopefully, may help policy-makers frame or modify banking regulations along with programs to improve financial inclusion and literacy in the US.

<br>
An initial analysis of the CFPB website and online reports also indicates a lack of effective and sticky messaging to ensure wider public awareness of such inequities. Through the Data Visualization course, I would like to try and contribute to a shift in more effective communication and public engagement.

The initial scope of the project is limited to Mortgages, though other types of consumer credit such as credit cards, auto loans, and personal loans may be included based on availability of data.
