# Financial-Services-Equity
An in-depth view of the US Consumer Finance Market &amp; Equity in Credit Lending.

Leveraging the data collected and published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), I would like to examine the level of inequity in the US consumer finance market, year-on-year trends in the same, and try to identify key factors behind it. This, hopefully, may help policy-makers frame or modify banking regulations along with programs to improve financial inclusion and literacy in the US.
An initial analysis of the CFPB website and online reports also indicates a lack of effective and sticky messaging to ensure wider public awareness of such inequities. Through the Data Visualization course, I would like to try and contribute to a shift in more effective communication and public engagement.
The initial scope of the project is limited to Mortgages, though other types of consumer credit such as credit cards, auto loans, and personal loans may be included based on availability of data.
